It seems for me like the example summary data doesn't match specification according to which: 
-Rocket on the ground shouldn't be assigned to any mission so then it shouldn't be visible in  summary(for example Transit mission)
-Pending mission status should be assigned only if one mission is in repair(for example Luna1 mission)
As i didn't get the answer from i assumed that it was mistake from client. 

AI was used for:
-correct gradle import pakages setup
-some base string formatting and comparision
