It seems for me like the example summary data doesn't match specification according to which:<br>
- Rocket on the ground shouldn't be assigned to any mission so then it shouldn't be visible in  summary(for example Transit mission)<br>
- Pending mission status should be assigned only if one mission is in repair(for example Luna1 mission)<br>
As i didn't get the answer from i assumed that it was mistake from client.<br>
<br>
AI was used for:<br>
- correct gradle import pakages setup<br>
- some base string formatting and comparision<br>
