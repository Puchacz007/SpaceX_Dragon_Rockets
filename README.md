It seems for me like the example summary data doesn't match specification according to which:

- Rocket on the ground shouldn't be assigned to any mission so then it shouldn't be visible in summary (for example Transit mission)
- Pending mission status should be assigned only if one mission is in repair (for example Luna1 mission)

As I didn't get the answer from the client, I assumed that it was a mistake.

AI was used for:

- Correct Gradle import package setup
- Some base string formatting and comparison
- README.md formatting
